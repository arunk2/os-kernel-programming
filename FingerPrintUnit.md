Multi Value Logic Based - Finger Print Unit
===========================================
Multiple-valued logic (MVL) - possibility to represent the information with more than two discrete levels. 
Representing data in a MVL system is more effective than the binary based representation, 
because the number of interconnections can be significantly reduced. 

The real advantage of higher-radix arithmetic is **fewer arithmetic operations**. 
Especially in bulk signal processing units, they may bring in highly sophisticated but less complicated expressions.

## Why Finger Print Application?
Fingerprint identification is a popular biometric identification technology. 
It includes 
- fingerprint verification
- fingerprint recognition.

Both of them have high computations based on complex formulas. 

They use **minutiae, such as end points and bifurcation points as features**. 
To correctly extract minutiae from fingerprint images becomes an essential step in fingerprint identification. 
It involves lot of computation for all its operations, makes it an ideal candidate for Multi-valued logic application.
